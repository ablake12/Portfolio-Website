Hello! Welcome to my repository for my Portfolio website! Here is where I developed the code for my website!

## Wireframes
I utilized Figma to create the wireframes for this website. Please check them out here:
[Wireframes](wireframes/website-wireframes.pdf)

## Tech Stack
I programmed this website using the Python Flask framework on the backend. For the frontend, I used HTML for the pages, CSS for styling the pages, and Javascript for various interactive elements on the pages. Additionally, I integrated Bootstrap to enhance the design with responsive and modern styling.

## Deployment
For the deployment, I used the AWS Elastic Beanstalk service.

## Pages
I have 6 pages for my website. Home, About, Resume, Portfolio, Jams, and Resume. Please visit them at their respective routes!
